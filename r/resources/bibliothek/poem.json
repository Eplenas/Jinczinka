    "text": "With gentle care, I mark thy skin. In trust, our spirits not within Carving wings upon thy back\nAn angel, glorified gift of heaven\n\nThe gift of blood, a sign of thee\nEntwined in ecstacy, sanguine we'll be\n\nIn this moment, we are one\nOur love, a burning, eternal sun\n\nAs I etch upon thy flesh,\n\nSo take my hand, and let me show\nThe depth of love that doth overflow\n\nA burgeoning masterpiece with every stroke\nYour hiraeth grimly known\n\nPriestly sliced\n\nYou’re patterned with strife,\nCheckers, stars, or stripes\n\nI mark thy skin not for dishonor,\n\nCleaving through the waves with pallid indifference,\nAcross the Arctic lay a sea of pearls\nGlimmering proudly, a wide swath expands\n\nSeraphim, don’t tell me now,\nHow beauty unfurls betwixt an oyster’s jaw.\nChapfallen, you say, well who's to blame?\nMe or you, I simmer in shame.\n\nWomen will rejoice, Antithetical jewels.\nBelly up a stray trout float,\nChoked inside with shell of fhfd.s.\n\nMagdalena, manner wheat chaff, could not compete\nSaintliness drawn taut across your quilted skin\n\n[Through Sapphic verse, I fell entranced,\nYour words so pure and fair,\nEach syllable a gentle touch,\nEvery rhyme a glimpse into the galaxy,\nYour poetry spoke to my soul,\nAnd made my heart whole,\nI am yours, forever enraptured,\nIn union with you, forever I will be nurtured.]\n\nAh angel of light, pure and fair\nPlumes of grace, now carved with care\nEach feather etched with tender touch,\nSacred act, holy clutch.\nI’ll make your body beautiful where you / cannot\n\nYour blood, my darling, ambrosia sweet,\nNectar divine, my euphoria gingered,\nSip of paradise, fleeting delight,\nMoment of bliss, heavenly bite.\n\nEnsnared earthily, you’re a caught hare\nBound in a body that weighs thee down\nWhile golden couplets the heavens crown\nUnbearably light, they soar with ease\nNow mere pinpricks, unknotting in the gauzy palette\nLeaving you lone below, flightless as a silkie pullet\n\n[Down are now your wings, but your latitude climbs]\n\nHow you long to join them up there\nFeel Zephyr tussle your golden hair\nScapuli hollowed, taken with trifle\nAh, how gloriously those feathers ruffle\nBut alas, you are condemned to crawl\nAnd watch the birds with jealous eyes,\nFor they have the freedom to roam the skies\n\nAhn, I know you dream of taking flight\nTo pilgrim on to God's gilt gates\nBut alas, your wings are mere phantoms, illustrious\nScabbed over raw, cicatrices still swarm\nAnd forever you are earthbound, confined."
